Late Binding and Type Mismatches: VBScript uses late binding by default, meaning type checking happens at runtime.  This can lead to runtime errors that are difficult to track down during development if you're not careful about data types. For instance, attempting to perform arithmetic operations on a variable that holds a string value instead of a number will result in an error only when the script executes that specific line.

Example:
```vbscript
dims = "10"
x = s + 5
```
This will cause a type mismatch error because 's' is a string.

Implicit Type Coercion Issues: VBScript's implicit type coercion can be subtle and lead to unexpected results. VBScript attempts to convert data types automatically in certain situations, but this conversion might not always be what you intend. This often happens when comparing values or performing operations across different types. 

Example:
```vbscript
if "10" = 10 then
  msgbox "Equal!"
end if
```
This comparison will evaluate to true because VBScript implicitly converts the string "10" to a number.  However, relying on implicit conversion can make the code harder to understand and debug.

Error Handling Limitations: VBScript's error handling mechanism is relatively basic.  The `On Error Resume Next` statement can mask errors, making debugging significantly harder because errors are not reported immediately.   Proper error handling is essential, but debugging when using `On Error Resume Next` demands more thorough testing.

Unexpected Object Behavior: When dealing with objects (like filesystem objects or COM objects), unexpected behavior can arise from improper object initialization, missing properties, or incorrect method calls.  Objects might not be properly cleaned up, leading to resource leaks.

Example:
```vbscript
Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
' ... use fso ...
' Missing Set fso = Nothing  (Leads to Resource Leak)
```

Unclosed Files and Connections:  Forgetting to properly close files or database connections after use can result in resource exhaustion and data corruption.

Example:
```vbscript
Set file = fso.CreateTextFile("myFile.txt", True)
' ...write to file...
'Missing file.Close
```

Dealing with Variant Data Type: The `Variant` data type in VBScript is flexible but can make debugging harder because it can hold values of different types. Unexpected type conversions can occur within the `Variant` context. Always try to use more specific types when you can to improve code clarity.
