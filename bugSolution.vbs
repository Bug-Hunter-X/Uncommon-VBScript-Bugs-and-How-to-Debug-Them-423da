Improved VBScript with Explicit Type Handling and Enhanced Error Management

To address the issues of late binding and implicit type conversions, we use explicit type declarations and avoid relying on implicit type coercion. 

Enhanced error handling is implemented to catch and manage errors more effectively.  The use of `On Error Resume Next` is avoided in favor of explicit error checks and `Err` object examination.

Resource management is improved with proper cleanup of objects and closing of files and database connections to prevent resource leaks. 

Example (Solution for Type Mismatch):
```vbscript
dim s as integer
s = 10
dim x as integer
x = s + 5
msgbox x
```

Example (Solution for Error Handling):
```vbscript
on error goto errhandler
' some code that might produce an error
' ...
exit sub
errhandler:
  msgbox "Error Number: " & Err.Number & vbCrLf & "Error Description: " & Err.Description
end sub
```

Example (Solution for Object Cleanup):
```vbscript
set fso = createobject("scripting.filesystemobject")
' ... use fso ...
set fso = nothing
```

By making these improvements, you significantly increase code readability, reliability, and reduce the likelihood of runtime errors.
